# Collection Repeat

For a working example of how to use collection-repeat, [http://codepen.io/rbose85/full/gbvLLx/](http://codepen.io/rbose85/full/gbvLLx/).

Building on the [CodePen](http://codepen.io/ionic/pen/mFygh) example, this is a simple demo of how to use the custom directive `collection-repeat` from the [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com).

The data being used to populate this demo is coming from [randomuser.me](http://randomuser.me).

The inspiration for how best to acquire data for this demo comes from the [ng-europe](http://ngeurope.org) 2014 talk by [Andrew Joslin](https://twitter.com/andrewtjoslin), available to watch on [YouTube](http://youtu.be/ZjPRj2Vp74U).

To learn more about the `collection-repeat` directive please see the [documentation](http://ionicframework.com/docs/api/directive/collectionRepeat).
